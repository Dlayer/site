                    <h2>What is Dlayer?</h2>
                    
                    <hr />
                    
                    <p class="lead">Dlayer is a web development tool aimed 
                        primarily at users that don't have any web design or 
                        web development experience.</p>
                        
                    <p>Dlayer has two core goals, the first is to simplify web 
                        development and web design and the second is to 
                        provide the user will full control over every element 
                        and attribute that can be used to create a web page 
                        and web site, these are two goals that initially 
                        appear to be very much at odds with each other.</p>
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simplify web development; A user should be able to 
                            build a web page and web site without writing a 
                            single line of HTML, CSS, JavaScript or code.</li>
                        <li>Provide full control; A user will have full control 
                            over every element and attribute that can be 
                            used to create a web page or web site without 
                            necessarily knowing what the attributes are.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <hr />
                    
                    <h2>When did development begin?</h2>
                    
                    <p>Development began in 2008, up until August 2015 Dlayer 
                        was a closed project that I worked on single handled, 
                        I took the decision to Open Source Dlayer for the 
                        reasons listed below:</p>
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want Dlayer to succeed, to do that it needs to 
                            be out there, an app that never ships is no good 
                            to anyone.</li>
                        <li>I want to build up a community around Dlayer and 
                            now that I have a solid base in place I can let the 
                            community have a say in where the app goes next, 
                            I obviously have my own plans but would love to 
                            hear from others.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <hr />
                    
                    <h2>Where is the Demo?</h2>
                    
                    <p>This site used to host the Dlayer app, now that I have 
                        Open Sourced the project I need to Separate the 
                        site content and app, I'm hoping to have that

                        sub domain of this site.</p>
