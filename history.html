					<h2 class="display-1">The history of Dlayer <small class="text-muted">How it came to
						be</small></h2>

					<hr />

					<p class="lead">As of August 2015 Dlayer is an Open
						Source project, the text below is from the original
						history page on Dlayer.com.</p>

					<h2>The idea <small class="text-muted">When was the lightbulb moment?</small></h2>

					<p>Thinking back I believe the initial idea for Dlayer solidified in
						early 2008, I can't pin down the exact date that I settled on the
						final idea but I do know that I had been thinking about the
						concept, either in parts or as a whole for at least a few years
						prior to 2008.</p>

					<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about why it took so long for
						the idea to cement and I believe now that before 2008 I wasn't
						completely sure of my abilities, for the majority of the previous
						decade I had either been working by myself or in very small teams
						with only junior members, I didn't have any peers to compare
						myself to. I started working in larger and more skilled teams
						after 2008 and became very conscious I had artificially limited
						some of my early development projects because I thought I wasn't
						able to complete them on my own or I was lacking certain
						skills.</p>

					<h2>The Dlayer that never was <small class="text-muted">Wistful thinking!</small></h2>

					<p>There was nearly a vaguely similar product to Dlayer in 2008, as in
						I nearly started working on a product with two other colleagues
						from work. At the time I was Head of Development at a small web
						development company in Newbury, UK, I would have been working on
						the product with one of the Product Managers, lets call him Foo
						and the Lead Designer, lets call him Bar.</p>

					<p>During a carpool drive home with Bar we talked about working on a
						project together, the plan was that he would do all the creative
						work and I would do all the development work, Foo was going to
						handle commercial and marketing.</p>

					<p>Before I continue with the story it needs to be stated that the
						proposed product was not Dlayer and it would never have been able
						to become Dlayer, it was a very simple template driven system.
						Bar was going to create thousands or small image and HTML assets
						and I was going to develop a system that would allow users to
						join them all together to create whatever they wanted.</p>

					<p>Although on the surface it could be argued that this product and
						Dlayer are similar the reality is they couldn't be any more
						different if they tried, it would be like attempting to argue
						that a unicycle and  Mercedes SLK are the same, oh my god, a
						car analogy. The two products differed both conceptually and
						architecturally, on top of that, Dlayer exists and is on the web,
						this imagined other product never even got to the planning
						stage.</p>

					<p>Why am I mentioning the other potential product here? Three
						reasons, firstly, full disclosure, I've no reason to hide
						anything, secondly, I know there is an link between the two
						products and never was, lastly, this all happened around the
						time I started working on Dlayer, 2008.</p>

					<p>Very boring and long story short, nothing happened, neither Foo or
						Bar were willing to commit to the product, even partially, it was
						all just a wistful dream.</p>

					<h2>Delayed start <small class="text-muted">Procrastination?</small></h2>

					<p>Between 2008 and early 2010 there was very little real development
						on what would later become the product you are reading about.
						During the mentioned time frame I wrote thousands of lines of
						code, mainly samples, endless documentation and created hundreds
						of diagrams detailing how I intended the app to work, however,
						very little real code.</p>

					<p>There are a multitude of reasons for the lack of development, two
						of the major reasons being that I met my wife to be and I moved
						over to contracting rather than full time development roles,
						time just managed to get away from me.</p>

					<h2>Development begins <small class="text-muted">Finally!</small></h2>

					<p>In early 2010 I realised how long I had been sitting on the concept
						for Dlayer and how very little I had to show for two years of
						work. I spent the next few months collating all my documentation
						and started planning the development of Dlayer. Development
						began in earnest during September, I had finally started
						development on the first real version of the product that would
						later become the concept that is currently hosted at
						Dlayer.com.</a></p>

					<p>Over the next 21 months I created two separate versions of Dlayer,
						they both stalled at exactly the same point, I kept stumbling
						with how I wanted to handle the relationship between a content
						page and a  content page template.</p>

					<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing, I had got far too close to the
						project, it took a meeting with my best friend, lets call him
						Dan to realise that. I let Dan have a play with the latest
						version and after a very long postmortem I realised my error,
						Dlayer was far too complicated, I had strayed from my original
						concept and primary goal, a user shouldn't need to understand
						web design or web development, Dlayer was at that point a tool
						only really usable by web developers.</p>

					<p>I gave myself a rather large kick in the arse and went back to
						my original notes and planned development for yet another version
						of Dlayer, third times a charm?</p>

					<p>I started the development of the current version on the 1st May
						2012, the current specification refers to this version and it
						very much mirrors the original concept I started outlining in
						2008.</p>
