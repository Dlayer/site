				<li>Minor style and content changes.</li>
				<li>Updated 'What is Dlayer?' page.</li>
				<li>Database work to support allowing a form to be imported as a content item.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.07 - Minor release, content items can be moved and heading content item updated. <small>23rd Dec 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If there is no data for a new user a sample site is created, three colour palettes are created and default values are set for the heading styles and base font family settings. Pages, templates and forms are not created, when the designers are more functional there will be sample templates, forms and pages for the sampkle site.</li>
				<li>Adding a new website now inserts initial values for the base font family to use in the content manager and form builder.</li>
				<li>Adding a new website now inserts initial values for the content manager heading styles, can be updated by the user in the settings.</li>
				<li>Add new site wasn't creating three default palettes for the user, later users will be able to define their own palettes during create site or modify the default palettes.</li>
				<li>Top menu updated to show state.</li>
				<li>Reworked the toolbar panels, now only show tools when relevant, the selected tool is clearer and styling has been updated. Tool options styling has been simplified, forms are now clearer.</li>
				<li>When I resized the designers I realised I had sinned, the width and heights were defaulted within the code, now corrected, there is no such thing as a value that won't need to be changed at some point during the projects life.</li>
				<li>Fixed the content manager heading tool, the left margin value wasn't being passed through in the post data array, this was causing the validate method to return FALSE and the tool to never process correctly. The heading tool now checks the size of the page block it is being added, this is done so that sensible defaults can be calculated and to ensure that a user can't add a heading container which is larger than the page block.</li>
				<li>Updated the styling in the form builder, matches the new design.</li>
				<li>Updated the styling in the content manager, matches the new design.</li>
				<li>Expand and Contract options for resize tool now no longer shows the options that can't be used for the selected block, previously all options were shown and the form button was disabled if not relevant. The ribbon has been moved to the right hand side below the tool buttons, no longer pushes the design down.</li>
				<li>Updated the styling in the template designer, matches the new design.</li>
				<li>Removed the mode switching buttons, don't really do anything yet, also, not sure where to add them in the new designer yet.</li>
				<li>Modified the base width of the app, now 1366 pixels, this will match the Windows 8 version of Dlayer when developed. All the base pages have been updated along with the setting sections.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.06 -  Minor release, validation, settings and general small fixes. <small>4th Dec 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Content items in the content manager can now be moved around, the user needs to select the page block then as they hover over the content items up and down movement links appear.</li>
				<li>Movement controls added to content items, not yet active.</li>
				<li>Added a container div around content items in the content designer, js hover and click events moved to the parent container item, this is so that the movement controls will only show for each content item on hover.</li>
				<li>Added width and left margin to heading content type, width and left padding when summed can be no larger than the containing page block.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.05 - Modifier system, password tool in form builder, new settings for form builder, template designer tool restrictions and general tweaks. <small>1st Dec 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Base font family settings set for the content manager and form builder now used in the designers.</li>
				<li>Container for text content can now no be larger that the page block it is being added to.</li>
				<li>Abstract validate and autoValidate methods moved from base tool class down a level into the base module tool class, additional context data will be needed for validations and it will differ by module.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.04 - Authentication system in place. <small>17th Nov 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Border tool re-instated in the template designer when a user chooses to work on a template block which has content applied to it on a page based upon the current template. A change width modifier has been added, this modifier checks all the content items to see if the widths for the containers need to be updated (The width of a page div will change if a border is added, edited or removed on a  template block). </li>
				<li>Base modifier system in place, this is called when there needs to be interaction between modules, if a user changes something in one module that affects data in another module modifiers can be sent requests to check to see if any changes are required and then make them if necessary.</li>
				<li>History of Dlayer split out from the What is Dlayer? page.</li>
				<li>Temporarily added the resize tool in the template designer to the disabled tools list if template div has content on an active page. I need to develop a system that makes changes to pages in the background when a template is updated, because the resize tool affects more than the selected div I have for now disabled access until I develop the system which updates data between modules.</li>
				<li>Added password tool to form builder, users can now add password fields to their forms.</li>
				<li>Updated the help text in form builder for text and textarea field tools, little more clear on what happens after a field has been added to their form.</li>
				<li>Added base font family settings to the form builder module, as per content manager module, value is not yet used in the designer.</li>
				<li>Updated the set tool action, when a tool has been disabled in the view the set tool action checks to ensure that the disabled URL can’t be called manually by the user.</li>
				<li>Added new icons for disabled toolbar buttons, desaturated version of the icon.</li>
				<li>In the template designer a tool can now be disabled if using it would be destructive. For example when a page is created from a template if the specified template div has content assigned to it on one or more pages, splitting the div would currently make the content appear to disappear. Logic needs to be added to gracefully handle these destructive changes, for now though the app just forbids access.</li>
				<li>Updated server to PHP 5.4, switched crypt() over to SHA_512, test identity credentials updated.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.03 - Minor release, added the base creation tools, new site, template, form and page. <small>10th Nov 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Once you create a page from a template there need to be restrictions in place to either limit what tools can be used on an active template or extra code to manage structural  changes behind the scenes. Until I put some initial restrictions in place I have disabled the template designer, hoping to re-enable it within the next two weeks.</li>
				<li>Added 1 sample site, 1 sample template and 1 sample page for each user, enough to allow people to play.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with the activate methods, validate template id action helper was using the wrong session when in the content module.</li>
				<li>Updated database, added defaults for all settings for the three test sites.</li>
				<li>Notification next to username/password combinations if the account if currently logged in. Added a &quot;What is dlayer?&quot; page, it gives a brief overview of Dlayer and the history behind it.
				</li>
				<li>No longer able to edit the name of the first sample site, used by the history tables and always defaulted if no other data in the system for identity.</li>
				<li>Site list now pulls sites based on identity. Updated site history table/code and action helper to check site id validity, now all use the current identity.</li>
				<li>Release messages highlighted in the development log.</li>
				<li>Added my authentication system to Dlayer, because demo usernames and passwords are exposed an account can only login from one location, timeout on session is an hour so if a user exists without logging out the account will become available for another user after an hour. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.02 - Minor release, fixed heading tool and made some UX tweaks to tools <small>23rd Oct 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Add and edit new page in place, user needs to choose template to base page upon, enter a name and also the title to use for the page, as the system evolves more will need to be defined. Removed addDefaultElementDecorators() methods from site form classes, no need to override the default in the base form class as nothing was being changed. </li>
				<li>Added add and edit form, currently a form is just a unique name for the site.</li>
				<li>Added add and edit template, currently a template is just a unique name for the site.</li>
				<li>Updated the formInputsData methods in forms, now checks the return type of model data and then acts accordingly, form elements now check to ensure data index exists before setting value.</li>
				<li>Added the ability to edit a site, as per add site a site is currently just a unique name, this will develop later.</li>
				<li>A user can now create a new site, a site is currently just a unique name.</li>
				<li>Added an activate method to allow the user to switch the template, page or form they are working on with the site.</li>
				<li>Template list, page list and form list now come from the database, not static text, design options only show for active item.</li>
				<li>Added a validate content id view helper, checks content id is valid, as in exists in the database and belongs to the site id in the session.</li>
				<li>Added a validate form id view helper, checks form id is valid, as in exists in the database and belongs to the site id in the session.</li>
				<li>Added a validate template id view helper, checks template id is valid, as in exists in the database and belongs to the site id in the session.</li>
				<li>Added a validate site id view helper, checks site id exists in session and also a valid site id, later it will also check against the user/auth id.</li>
				<li>User is now able to choose a new site to work on from the sites list. On selecting the last accessed site is updated so that the next time the user accesses Dlayer the last accessed site is selected. As there is no authentication system yet site changes will affect all users.</li>
				<li>List of sites now pulled from database on home page, adding a link to allow user to activate a site rather than default to the first.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>v0.01 - Initial alpha release! <small>14th Oct 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a small bug with heading tool, view script folder case incorrect, errored on case indifferent servers.</li>
				<li>After adding or editing a text block the base content block remains selected, tool and content ids now cleared, better usability than previous set up.</li>
				<li>There are two exit modes for a tool, multi-use where all session values remain and non multi-use when they are all cleared, for the content manager added a third mode to enable some vars to be kept.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Started publically showing updates, SVN log extends much further back in history but I saw no need to transfer messages across. <small>4th Apr 2013</small></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Set sensible values for text box width and padding, uses the containing div as a guide.</li>
				<li>Added the ability to edit both the heading and text content types. User chooses a div and then the content block, ribbon updates and they make the required changes.</li>
				<li>Modified the styling, switched to a light theme, going to work better for the alpha due to the limited number of tools in all the modules, darker theme can be added back in as an option later.</li>
				<li>Base content view helper, div_id was incorrectly commented as being the id of the div currently selected on the page, for adding content. Code and comments updated to make it clear that it actually refers to the id of the current div in the content data array. Added a method to set the id for the the currently selected div, if any.</li>
				<li>Render method on the base view helper was being called twice because of the way it was designer, removed the call to render() in toString() and now call render directly.</li>
				<li>Simple text content block can now be added to the selected element.</li>
				<li>Heading tool class now in place, heading can be added to the selected element, get positioned at the end of any existing content, obviously this will change with additional development.</li>
				<li>Ribbon forms in place for add heading and add text, now need to work on the tool processing code.</li>
				<li>Initial content module ribbon development, ribbon classes and models.</li>
				<li>Added new tool icons for the form builder and content manager and updated the cancel image for all three modules, didn't match the rest of the images.</li>
				<li>Split the content data methods out into their own models to match the rest of the system and as pre-planning for additional changes. Moved the margin settings for a heading, was defined in the heading styles settings, now defined per heading.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with the manual split tools, javascript wasn't taking the border of the parent element into account when drawing and calculating the split position and size of the new children.</li>
				<li>At the start of building this version of Dlayer I modified my development approach a little for this project. Typically I can plan the models and classes required to solve a problem fairly easily, with Dlayer because of the complexity I opted for a more procedural approach, this allowed me to put in place the structure for the first designer (template designer) which I then duplicated and modified for the form builder and content manager.

					All three modules ended up with a very similar base, for the last week I’ve been refactoring the code adding core classes and models which handle the majority of the base functionality for each module, the ribbon, tool bars and tool processing code.
				</li>
				<li>Reworked the form module ribbon data classes, now rely more on the base abstract class and there is less duplication, system mirrors the more functional template designer.</li>
				<li>Reworked the template module ribbon data classes, now rely more on the base abstract class and there is less duplication, fixed a small bug when changing borders, incorrect id var was being used.</li>
				<li>Added a selected state to the toolbar buttons in the template designer, content manager and form builder.</li>
				<li>Full app testing, fixed three minor bugs relating to the resize and border tools.</li>
				<li>Site id was missing from 6 of the child layout tables, added site id, updated the models and simplified some of the layout queries that no longer need to do a join.</li>
				<li>There was a layout file per module, because of the app design this wasn't needed, now use one layout file and the controller has an array of the css and js includes required for the controller actions.</li>
				<li>My standard development practice is to add enabled fields to most tables, the app takes the status fields into account and either processes, adds etc based on the status. Dlayer is an alpha level app at the moment, even though it is small, currently 36 tables, I don't need anything complicating the code, as such I have removed the enabled field from most tables. It still exists in a few base tables which control access to modules and access to tools but has been removed elsewhere. As parts of the app get more stable I will add back in the status fields as required.</li>
				<li>Added a font size validator, PHP and JS. Added a hex regex for validation to the Dlayer JS object. Updated all the text in the app, now simpler and more consistent. Added custom titles to all pages. Updated for form formatting in the form builder, now appears against a white preview div.</li>
				<li>Added new ribbon helper images for the resize tool and border tool</li>
				<li>Added new ribbon helper images for the split vertical and split horizontal tool, in the style of the new tool icons.</li>
				<li>Added new tool icons for the template designer, setting the new style for the app, going for a sketchy look.</li>
				<li>Updated the tool bars in the three designers, tool icons are going to be larger.</li>
				<li>Re-skinned the designers, content manager, template designer and form builder</li>
				<li>Re-skinned the app, new styling on the splash page, setting pages, base pages and development log.</li>
				<li>Added a splash page to the app, this will be where the user logs in to get to their control panel.</li>
				<li>Added the ability to define the base font family in the content module, the value is not currently being used by the designer, that support will be added shortly.</li>
				<li>Added a base font families table to the database and a corresponding font families settings table, allows the user to define the base font family per site/module, as in a base font family for the content manager and then the base font family for forms, support for the widget designer will be added later.</li>
				<li>Added the heading content type view helper to the content module, initially it adds all the header tag styles inline, this will be rectified later.</li>
				<li>Updated database and code, all fields relating to colour update to color_hex as that is currently what the field contains, later we can add a colour object is required with the RGB values and palette data, keeping things simple initially.</li>
				<li>Removed RGB entries for colours in the database, not required at the moment, going to just use hex values initially.</li>
				<li>Updated static validation helper class, now calls the new colorHex validation class</li>
				<li>Added some default styling to the app, a tags and list items.</li>
				<li>Added tabs to the content manager settings page, going to be too many settings for one page and the new layout will allow more detail to be given to the user.</li>
				<li>Moved all the jquery required for the initial content module settings into the Dlayer js object.</li>
				<li>Upgraded to jquery-1.10.2, fixed a small jquery issue with chrome, multi-line comment at top of script.</li>
				<li>Refactored the designer js, all modules, simplifed the base dlayer object and moved all the js that was sitting in view files. Structure of the scripts folder now matches images and styles folders.</li>
				<li>Added live preview to the content settings page (header styles) defaults to show saved styles and then on change updates the previews.</li>
				<li>Added initial styling for the heading setting forms and added initial styling for the heading previews.</li>
				<li>Added the forms for the content headings to the content settings page, initially it just allows the user to update the params for the headings, there is no live preview or formatting.</li>
				<li>Template module tool process methods now double check that the tool posted matches the tool defined in the session.</li>
				<li>Pagination view helper wasn't escaping all developer defined text.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with the expand and contact tabs of the resize tool in the template designer, border widths were not being added to div width meaning that the split positions were not being calculated correctly.</li>
				<li>Form fields not being pulled from database in correct order.</li>
				<li>Multi use tool setting was not being respected in the form builder when adding a new field, field id was not being stored in session.</li>
				<li>Updated the template module and template session class, updated names of some logic vars, names more clear, wasn't always obvious what a var referred to.</li>
				<li>Edit mode in place for form text fields and form textarea fields</li>
				<li>Form module ribbon forms now show existing values when in edit mode.</li>
				<li>Public set methods (div and form field) now check that the given id belongs to the currently set template/form and site.</li>
				<li>Reworked the javascript, selector functions have been moved to the module javascript files rather than the base Dlayer object.</li>
				<li>Field attributes are now saved to the database and then pulled in the form builder and attached to the inputs.</li>
				<li>The add field forms in the form builder now add the attributes for the text and textarea field types.</li>
				<li>Added initial styling for the form builder forms.</li>
				<li>Form builder now supports and displayed text area fields which have been added to the form defintion.</li>
				<li>Text area field can now be added to the form, edit mode still needs to be added.</li>
				<li>Text field can now be added to a form in the form builder, still need to add supporting for editing a field.</li>
				<li>Added base tool process model for the form builder, working on the add text field process tool model.</li>
				<li>Updated the pagination view helper, can now show either 'item n-m of o' or 'page n of m' between the next and previous links.</li>
				<li>Added the form for the add textarea tool in the forms builder.</li>
				<li>Updated all the help text for the template designer, simpler language.</li>
				<li>Updated the base forms class, addElementsToForm() method updated, now able to create multiple fieldsets within a form, one fieldset per method call</li>
				<li>Added the form for the add text field tool in the forms builder.</li>
				<li>Updated the default styling for tables, header rows and table rows.</li>
				<li>Updated the pagination view helper, added the ability to define text to use for links and also updated the logic for 'of n' text.</li>
				<li>Added a helper class to the library, initially only a couple of static helper functions.</li>
				<li>Added a pagination view helper, update of my existing pagination view helper.</li>
				<li>Added a development log to Dlayer to show changes to the application, two reasons, one to spur on my development, two, to show the public what I am adding.</li>
