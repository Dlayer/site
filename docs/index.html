						the Dlayer app, they aren't complete, Dlayer is very much 
						an alpha project and so are its docs.</p>

					<hr />

					<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

					<p>Dlayer is a web development tool aimed 
						primarily at users that don't have any web design or 
						web development experience.</p>

					<p>Dlayer has two core goals, the first is to simplify web 
						development and web design and the second is to 
						provide the user will full control over every element 
						and attribute that can be used to create a web page 
						and web site, these are two goals that initially 
						appear to be very much at odds with each other.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Simplify web development; A user should be able to 
							build a web page and web site without writing a 
							single line of HTML, CSS, JavaScript or code.</li>
						<li>Provide full control; A user will have full control 
							over every element and attribute that can be 
							used to create a web page or web site without 
							necessarily knowing what the attributes are.</li>
					</ul>

					<hr />

					<h2 id="the-designers">The designers</h2>

					<p>Dlayer is split up into a number of modules, from this 
						point on they will be referred to as designers.</p>
						
					<p>There are currently eight designers in Dlayer, each one 
						has been tailored to handle one aspect of the web 
						development process in the best possible way. It 
						would be relatively simple to develop a single 
						designer that handled multiple aspects of the web 
						development process but early on I decided that I 
						wanted the user to able to concentrate on just one 
						task with as few distractions as possible.</p>
						
					<p>The designers all have a very similar layout, this 
						is to try and ensure that the app feels familiar 
						whichever designer the user is in, it will also 
						hopefully reduce the learning curve.</p>
						
					<p>The tools and tool side bar sit to the right of the 
						design area, tools and their options will only 
						displayed when they are relevant to the current 
						context, it will be very rare to see buttons for 
						tools that the user can't use. Tools will have a 
						minimum of two option panels, a help tab explaining 
						the tool and at least one option set.</p>
						
					<p>With the exception of the Website manager and Data 
						manager the design area will show as close to possible 
						a visually accurate representation of the user's 
						design as possible.</p>
						
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="template-designer">Template designer</h2>
					
					<p>A template defines the basic structure of a content 
						page, all content pages are built upon a template.</p>
						
					<p>Templates are typically simply although there is 
						nothing limiting the creation of complex templates, 
						think of them as a way of blocking out content areas, 
						the obvious examples being where the header, footer 
						and main content areas are on a content page.</p>
						
					<p>When a new web site is created the Template designer 
						will be stocked with a number of default templates 
						which the user is free to modify in any way they want, 
						copy or even delete, they are just there to help the 
						user get started.</p>
					
					<p>Widgets and forms can be added directly to templates, 
						they don't necessarily need to be added to content 
						pages, although a user can add widgets and forms they 
						can't edit them within the Template designer, that 
						needs to be done within the relevant designer, at 
						any point the user will be able to jump to the 
						relevant designer, make a change and then jump back, 
						the state of the designer will remain intact.</p>
					
					<p>There are no artificial limits to the number of 
						templates you can design for a web site, the number 
						of content pages based upon a single template or how 
						many items can be added to them. Forms and widgets 
						can be added to templates but typically most of the 
						content and flourish that makes up a content page 
						will be added in the Content manager.</p>
						
					<hr />
						
					<h2 id="content-manager">Content manager</h2>
					
					<p>Websites are essentially a collection of content pages 
						consisting of content items. Content is a very generic 
						term, a content item in Dlayer could be a single 
						image, a text block, form, poll or a widget in the 
						form of an image gallery, blog or even a simple 
						twitter feed.</p>
						
					<h3 id="cm-content-pages">Content pages</h3>
					
					<p>A content page is simply that, a page which contains 
						some content.</p>
					
					<p>In Dlayer there is a simple hierarchy to a content 
						page, at first it may appear complicated but 
						essentially there are only three levels that a user 
						will interact with directly, content areas, content 
						rows and content items.</p>
					
					<p>A content page is created from a template, a template 
						in its simplest form blocks out the different areas 
						of a page, typical examples being an area for the 
						site header, another for the footer and a main area 
						where the main page content goes. Please refer to 
						the Template designer documentation for full details 
						on templates.</p>
						
					<p>There are no artificial limits to the number or content 
						pages a user can create or the number of content 
						items that can be assigned to either a page or content 
						row, a user has full control over everything.</p>
					
					<p>Note: The tools in the Content manger are not at per 
						my final design, they are a currently just a stepping 
						stone. As it stands today when adding or editing 
						content all data is managed in the side panel, as 
						development continues the tools will be updated to 
						allow more data to be managed directly within the 
						design view.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-content-areas">Content areas</h3>
					
					<p>A content area is an invisible container, content 
						areas are the sections marked out on your template in 
						the Template designer, you can't alter them in the 
						Content manager, only change their display.</p>
					
					<p>A content area should be used to separate areas of your 
						content pages, for example, you might have a content 
						area for the header and navigation items, one for the 
						footer items and one for the main content that makes 
						up your content page.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-content-rows">Content rows</h3>
					
					<p>A content row is an invisible container that spans the 
						entire width of a content area, it is used primarily 
						to control the layout and size of the content items 
						it contains.</p>
					
					<p>Dlayer uses a HTML, CSS, and JS framework called 
						Bootstrap, content rows in Dlayer are called rows in 
						Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a very clever system that 
						splits each row into a number of columns, these can 
						then be used for sizing and positioning, Dlayer builds 
						upon this.</p>
						
					<p>There are twelve columns to a content row, when a 
						content item is created a sensible size is initially 
						set by Dlayer, Dlayer looks at the type of item 
						being created and how many other items there are in 
						the row, refer to the documentation for each tool to 
						see how this is calculated.</p>
						
					<p>Although content rows are invisible to the public that 
						does not have to be the case, please refer to the 
						content row tool documentation for more 
						information.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-content-items">Content items</h3>
					
					<p>Content items are the fragments that make up a content 
						page, there are two base types of content items within 
						Dlayer, simple and dynamic.</p>
						
					<p>All content items, regardless of their type, are 
						attached by reference so there is never any 
						duplication of content within the app.</p>
						
					<h4>Simple</h4>
					
					<p>Simple content items are the content items that can 
						be created using the tools within the Content manager, 
						there are many types, some examples being a heading, 
						image, carousel, or text block.</p>
					
					<p>The ability to customise simple content items varies 
						greatly depending on the content item, for a full 
						overview of each of the content item types please 
						refer to the documentation for the relevant content 
						tool.</p>
					
					<h4>Dynamic</h4>
					
					<p>A dynamic content item is an object created in one of 
						the content designers in Dlayer, the Form builder, 
						Widget designer or Question manager.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-tools">Tools</h3>
					
					<p>This following sections contains an overview for each 
						of the tools in the Content manager and documentation 
						on moving around and using the tools in the Content 
						manager.</p>
						
					<p>There are three types of tools, structure tools, 
						creation tools and import tools.</p>
						
					<p>In addition to containing all the tools that help with 
						the structure of a content page the structure 
						section also contains tools to help a user navigate 
						around the designer.</p>
						
					<p>The vast majority of data used to build content items 
						is attached by reference, this allows the same piece 
						of data to be shared between multiple content items 
						without any duplication. In addition this also allows 
						a user to update multiple content items in a single 
						action, refer to documentation for each tool for 
						additional details.</p>
						
					<h4>Live previews</h4>
					
					<p>Live previews of changes show in the design view for 
						most of the tools in the Content manager when they 
						are in edit mode.</p>
						
					<p>If the tool supports live previews the design view 
						will be updated as changes are made to the tool forms, 
						in addition, a message will appear at the top of the 
						form to inform the user that there are unsaved 
						changes.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-item-selection">Item selection</h3>
					
					<p>To use any of the tools in the Content manager a user 
						needs to select an item to work with, this could be a 
						content area, content row or content item.</p>
												
					<h4>Content area</h4>
					
					<p>A content area can be selected when no tools or other 
						selections are active, to select a content area the 
						user simple hovers their mouse over an area, it will 
						highlight indicating that it can be selected. Once a 
						content area is selected access to content rows is 
						granted.</p>
						
					<h4>Content row</h4>
					
					<p>To select a content row the user first needs to select 
						the content area that the content row belongs to. 
						Once the content area has been selected the content 
						rows will highlight when the user moves the mouse 
						over them. To select a content row the user simply 
						needs to click the mouse. Once a content row is 
						selected access to content items is granted.</p>
						
					<p>When a content row is selected the designer will 
						allow the user to select any other sibling content 
						row, a sibling content row is a row within the same 
						content area.</p>
						
					<h4>Content item</h4>
					
					<p>To select a content item the user first needs to 
						select the content row that the content item belongs 
						to. Once the content row has been selected the 
						content items will highlight when the user moves 
						the mouse over them. To select a content item the 
						user simply needs to click the mouse.</p>
					
					<p>When a content item is selected the designer will 
						allow the user to select any other sibling content 
						item, a sibling content item is an item within the 
						same content row.</p>
											
					<h3 id="cm-moving-and-ordering">Moving and ordering</h3>
					
					<p>Content rows and content items can both be moved to a 
						new parent which effectively moves them on the content 
						page or have their ordering altered in relation to 
						their siblings.</p>
					
					<h4>Content rows</h4>
					
					<p>To move a content row between content areas a user 
						needs to use the move row tool, when a content row is 
						selected the move tool will be available for 
						selection.</p>
						
					<p>To change the ordering of a content row within a 
						content area a user can use the visual controls. 
						When a content row is selectable and a user hovers 
						over it they will depending on context see a display 
						later and display sooner button. To alter the 
						ordering of the content row in relation to its 
						siblings the user simply needs to click the relevant 
						button.</p>
						
					<h4>Content items</h4>
					
					<p>To move a content item between content rows a user 
						needs to use the move item tool, when a content 
						item is selected the move tool will be available 
						for selection.</p>
						
					<p>To change the ordering of a content item within a 
						content row a user can use the visual controls. 
						When a content item is selectable and a user hovers 
						over it they will depending on context see a display 
						later and display sooner button. To alter the 
						ordering of the content item in relation to its 
						siblings the user simply needs to click the relevant 
						button.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-structure-tools">Structure tools</h3>
					
					<p>The structure tools control the structure of a content 
						page and also allow content rows and content items to 
						be moved around the content page.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-st-add-content-row">Add content row</h4>
					
					<p>The add content row tool allows a user to add a new 
						content row to the selected content area. To add a 
						content row the user simply needs to click the add 
						row button.</p>
						
					<p>The new content row will be added after the other 
						content rows in the area and will immediately be 
						selected by Dlayer, the user can then add content 
						items or manage the content row itself.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-st-content-row">Content row</h4>
					
					<p>The content row tool is automated selected by Dlayer 
						when a user selects a content row.</p>
						
					<p>The content row tool only exists to allow access to 
						the content row sub tools.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-st-move-row">Move row</h4>
					
					<p>The move row tool allows a user to move a content row 
						from one content area to another, the tool is only 
						visible when a content row has been selected.</p>
						
					<p>The tool has a select menu containing the names of the 
						content areas that make up the page, as the user 
						selects an option from the list the relevant content 
						area will highlight, to move the row the user simply 
						needs to click the move button.</p>
						
					<p>The content row will be moved to the new content area 
						and positioned after any other content rows.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-st-move-item">Move item</h4>
					
					<p>The move item tool allows a user to move a content 
						item from one content row to another, the tool is 
						only visible when a content item has been selected.</p>
						
					<p>The tool has a select menu containing the names of 
						all the content rows that make up the page, as the 
						user selects an option from the list the relevant 
						content row will highlight, to move the item the 
						user simply needs to click the move button.</p>
						
					<p>The content item will be moved to the new content row 
						and positioned after any other content rows.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-st-select-parent">Select parent</h4>
					
					<p>The select parent tool allows a user to move up the 
						hierarchy when they have a content item selected.</p>
						
					<p>The tool has three options, the user can select the 
						content row the item belongs to, the content area or 
						return to the edit mode for the selected content 
						item.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-create-tools">Create tools</h3>
					
					<p>The create tools are used to create content items, 
						there is a tool for each of the simple content types 
						supported by Dlayer.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-ct-heading">Heading</h4>
					
					<p>The heading tool allows a user to add a new heading 
						content item to the selected content row. To add a 
						heading item the user needs to define the heading, 
						an optional sub heading, select the heading type and 
						also define a name by which they can identify the 
						text later.</p>
						
					<p>The text which a user assigns when creating a heading 
						item gets stored independently to the data which 
						defines the position, styling and layout of the 
						heading item, the text content is never duplicated 
						in the app. When the text is stored in the database 
						it is saved against the name that was assigned when 
						the heading item was created.</p>
						
					<p>A heading item will automatically be sized to span the 
						entire width of the content row it has been assigned 
						to.</p>
					
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the heading item to 
						any value between one and 12, they will also be able 
						to set the offsetting value. The offsetting value is 
						the amount of free space that appears to the left of 
						the heading item. The sum of the size and offsetting 
						must be a value between one and 12, if the size is 
						set to six the offsetting value will be limited to 
						values between zero and six. The size and position 
						sub tool is available in edit mode along with all 
						the other sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>In edit mode the form will include an instances field 
						if the text content assigned to the heading item is 
						being used in more than one active heading item. The 
						instances field controls whether or not any text 
						changes affect all the linked heading items or just 
						the current heading item. If the user chooses no 
						when updating a heading item Dlayer will automatically 
						store the new text in the database and increment the 
						name.</p>
						
					<p>The styling options for the six heading types are 
					defined in the Content manager settings. Although a user 
					will be able to override the styling options on a case by 
					case basis it makes sense for the user to make their 
					changes in the headings section to maintain consistency 
					in the typography across their web site.</p>
					
					<h5>Sub tools</h5>
					
					<p>The heading tool has two sub tools, the size and 
						position tool and the styling tool.</p>
						
					<p>The size and position tool allows a user to define 
						both the width of the content item and its offset. 
						The width and offset values need to be a value 
						between one and 12 and the sum of the two values 
						cannot be larger the twelve, refer to the content 
						row section to read up on why widths needs to be 
						expressed in twelfths.</p>
						
					<p>The styling tool allows a user to define the background 
						colour for the heading item and the heading item 
						container. The user can select colours by clicking 
						the colour fields, this will activate the colour 
						picker allowing them to select a colour from any 
						of the site's colour palettes, by choosing a colour 
						from a list of the last 5 used across the site or by 
						manually entering a hex value, an assigned value 
						can be cleared using the clear button.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-ct-text">Text</h4>
					
					<p>The text tool allows a user to add a new text content 
						item to the selected content row. To add a text item 
						the user needs to define the text and also define a 
						name by which they can identify the text later.</p>
						
					<p>The text which a user assigns when creating a text 
						item gets stored independently to the data which 
						defines the position, styling and layout of the 
						text item, the text content is never duplicated 
						in the app. When the text is stored in the database 
						it is saved against the name that was assigned when 
						the text item was created.</p>
						
					<p>The initial size of a newly inserted text item depends 
						upon whether or not the user has added any other 
						content items to the selected content row. The 
						sizing logic in Dlayer will attempt to calculate a 
						sensible size for the text item based on the size 
						of all the content items which currently appear 
						before it in the content row. The goal of the sizing 
						logic is to set a size for the text item so that it 
						fills any remaining space in the content row. Behind 
						the scenes there is a minimum and suggested maximum 
						size, for a text item the values are three and 12. 
						If the sizing logic calculates a size below the 
						minimum it will set the size to the suggested maximum 
						and drop the new text item down below its siblings. 
						If the text item is the only item in the content row 
						the suggested maximum width is automatically 
						applied.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the text item to any 
						value between one and 12, they will also be able to 
						set the offsetting value. The offsetting value is the 
						amount of free space that appears to the left of the 
						text item. The sum of the size and offsetting must 
						be a value between one and 12, if the size is set to 
						six the offsetting value will be limited to values 
						between zero and six. The size and position sub tool 
						is available in edit mode along with all the other 
						sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>In edit mode the form will include an instances field 
						if the text content assigned to the text item is being 
						used in more than one active text item. The instances 
						field controls whether or not any text changes affect 
						all the linked text items or just the current text 
						item. If the user chooses no when updating a text 
						item Dlayer will automatically store the new text in 
						the database and increment the name.</p>
						
					<h5>Sub tools</h5>
					
					<p>The text tool has two sub tools, the size and position 
						tool and the styling tool.</p>
						
					<p>The size and position tool allows a user to define 
						both the width of the content item and its offset. 
						The width and offset values need to be a value 
						between one and 12 and the sum of the two values 
						cannot be larger than 12, please refer to the content 
						row section to read up on why widths needs to be 
						expressed in twelfths.</p>
					
					<p>The styling tool allows a user to define the 
						background colour for the text item and the text 
						item container. The user can select colours by 
						clicking the colour fields, this will activate the 
						colour picker allowing them to select a colour from 
						any of the site's colour palettes, by choosing a 
						colour from a list of the last 5 used across the 
						site or by manually entering a hex value, an assigned 
						value can be cleared using the clear button.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-ct-form">Form</h4>
					
					<p>The form tool allows a user to add a form to the 
						selected content row. To add a form the user simply 
						needs to select the form that they would like to 
						insert from all the forms defined in the Form 
						builder.</p>
						
					<p>The initial size of a newly inserted form depends upon 
						whether or not the user has added any other content 
						items to the selected content row. The sizing logic 
						in Dlayer will attempt to calculate a sensible size 
						for the form based on the size of all the content 
						items which currently appear before it in the content 
						row. The goal of the sizing logic is to set a size 
						for the form so that it fills any remaining space in 
						the content row. Behind the scenes there is a minimum 
						and suggested maximum size, for a form the values are 
						three and 12. If the sizing logic calculates a size 
						below the minimum it will set the size to the 
						suggested maximum and drop the form down below its 
						siblings. If the form is the only item in the content 
						row the suggested maximum width is automatically 
						applied.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the form to any value 
						between one and 12, they will also be able to set the 
						offsetting value. The offsetting value is the amount 
						of free space that appears to the left of the form. 
						The sum of the size and offsetting must be a value 
						between one and 12, if the size is set to six the 
						offsetting value will be limited to values between 
						zero and six. The size and position sub tool is 
						available in edit mode along with all the other 
						sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>In edit mode an edit sub tool appears, this allows the 
						user to edit the form by jumping to the Form builder. 
						The user will be taken directly to the Form builder 
						with the form selected, at any point they can return 
						to the Content manager to see their changes, the 
						state of the Content manager is maintained 
						throughout.</p>
						
					<h5>Sub tools</h5>
					
					<p>The form tool has three sub tools, the edit tool, the 
						size and position tool and the styling tool.</p>
						
					<p>Forms need to be edited in the Form builder, the edit 
						tool allows a user to jump directly to the Form builder 
						designer view with the form selected. After making 
						their changes in the Form builder the user can click a 
						button to return back to the Content manager, the 
						state of the designer will have been maintained. The 
						form content item will immediately show all the 
						changed that were made in the Form builder.</p>
						
					<p>The size and position tool allows a user to define both 
						the width of the content item and its offset. The 
						width and offset values need to be a value between 
						one and 12 and the sum of the two values cannot be 
						larger than 12, please refer to the content row 
						section to read up on why widths needs to be 
						expressed in twelfths.</p>
						
					<p>The styling tool allows a user to define the 
						background colour for the text item and the text item 
						container. The user can select colours by clicking the 
						colour fields, this will activate the colour picker 
						allowing them to select a colour from any of the 
						sites colour palettes, by choosing a colour from a

					<h4 id="cm-ct-jumbotron">Jumbotron</h4>
					
					<p>The jumbotron tool allows a user to add a new 
						jumbotron content item to the selected content row. 
						A jumbotron is ideal for either acting as the main 
						heading for a page or to highlight important piece of 
						content. To add a jumbotron item the user needs to 
						define the title, the sub title text, the label for 
						an optional button and also define a name by which 
						they can identify the text later.</p>
						
					<p>The text which a user assigns when creating a jumbotron 
						item gets stored independently to the data which 
						defines the position, styling and layout of the 
						jumbotron item, the text content is never duplicated 
						in the app. When the text is stored in the database 
						it is saved against the name that was assigned when 
						the jumbotron item was created.</p>
						
					<p>A jumbotron item will automatically be sized to span 
						the entire width of the content row it has been 
						assigned to.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the jumbotron item to 
						any value between one and 12, they will also be able 
						to set the offsetting value. The offsetting value is 
						the amount of free space that appears to the left of 
						the jumbotron item. The sum of the size and offsetting 
						must be a value between one and 12, if the size is 
						set to six the offsetting value will be limited to 
						values between zero and six. The size and position 
						sub tool is available in edit mode along with all the 
						other sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>In edit mode the form will include an instances field 
						if the text content assigned to the jumbotron item is 
						being used in more than one active jumbotron item. 
						The instances field controls whether or not any text 
						changes affect all the linked jumbotron items or 
						just the current jumbotron item. If the user chooses 
						no when updating a jumbotron item Dlayer will 
						automatically store the new text in the database 
						and increment the name.</p>
						
					<h5>Sub tools</h5>
					
					<p>The jumbotron tool has two sub tools, the size and 
						position tool and the styling tool.</p>
						
					<p>The size and position tool allows a user to define 
						both the width of the content item and its offset. 
						The width and offset values need to be a value 
						between one and 12 and the sum of the two values 
						cannot be larger than 12, please refer to the content 
						row section to read up on why widths needs to be 
						expressed in twelfths.</p>
						
					<p>The styling tool allows a user to define the background 
						colour for the jumbotron item. The user can select a 
						colour by clicking the colour field, this will 
						activate the colour picker allowing them to select 
						a colour from any of the site’s colour palettes, by 
						choosing a colour from a list of the last 5 used 
						across the site or by manually entering a hex value, 
						an assigned value can be cleared using the clear 
						button.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-ct-image">Image</h4>
					
					<p>The image tool allows a user to add an image to the 
						selected content row. To add an image a user needs to 
						select the image that they would like to add, set the 
						expand setting and optionally define a caption which 
						appears below the image. To select an image the user 
						invokes the image picker, the image picker helps the 
						user filter down the images in their Image library by 
						category and sub category. Once filtered the user is 
						asked to select an image and finally if applicable a 
						version of that image.</p>
						
					<p>The initial size of a newly inserted image depends 
						upon whether or not the user has added any other 
						content items to the selected content row. The sizing 
						logic in Dlayer will attempt to calculate a sensible 
						size for the image based on the size of all the 
						content items which currently appear before it in the 
						content row. The goal of the sizing logic is to set a 
						size for the image so that it fills any remaining 
						space in the content row. Behind the scenes there is 
						a minimum and suggested maximum size, for an image 
						the values are one and six. If the sizing logic 
						calculates a size below the minimum it will set the 
						size to the suggested maximum and drop the form down 
						below its siblings. If the form is the only item in 
						the content row the suggested maximum width is 
						automatically applied.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the image to any value 
						between one and 12, they will also be able to set the 
						offsetting value. The offsetting value is the amount 
						of free space that appears to the left of the image. 
						The sum of the size and offsetting must be a value 
						between one and 12, if the size is set to six the 
						offsetting value will be limited to values between 
						zero and six. The size and position sub tool is 
						available in edit mode along with all the other 
						sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>A user can only test the expand setting when they view 
						a preview of their content page, the expand controls 
						cannot be added in the design window because they 
						interfere with the Dlayer selection controls.</p>
						
					<h5>Sub tools</h5>
					
					<p>The image tool has two sub tools, the size and position 
						tool and the styling tool.</p>
						
					<p>The size and position tool allows a user to define both 
						the width of the content item and its offset. The width 
						and offset values need to be a value between one and 12 
						and the sum of the two values cannot be larger than 12, 
						please refer to the content row section to read up on 
						why widths needs to be expressed in twelfths.</p>
						
					<p>The styling tool allows a user to define the background 
						colour for the image content container. The user can 
						select a colour by clicking the colour field, this 
						will activate the colour picker allowing them to 
						select a colour from any of the site’s colour palettes, 
						by choosing a colour from a list of the last 5 used 
						across the site or by manually entering a hex value, 
						an assigned value can be cleared using the clear 
						button.</p>
					
					<h3 id="cm-import-tools">Import tools</h3>
					
					<p>The import tools allow a user to create content items 
						using data that already exists within Dlayer. They are 
						only used to add content items, once a content item 
						has been created using the import tools it will from 
						that point on act as a standard content item.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-it-text">Text</h4>
					
					<p>The import text tool allows a user to add a new text 
						content item using text content from a previously 
						created text item, both current and deleted. When a 
						user selects the text content to use from the select 
						menu the text field will be populated with the saved 
						data.</p>
						
					<p>The user is free to modify the imported text, if 
						changed, upon insertion Dlayer will save the new text 
						content to the database and increment the name used 
						to identify the text.</p>
						
					<p>The initial size of a newly inserted text item depends 
						upon whether or not the user has added any other 
						content items to the selected content row. The sizing 
						logic in Dlayer will attempt to calculate a sensible 
						size for the text item based on the size of all the 
						content items which currently appear before it in 
						the content row. The goal of the sizing logic is to 
						set a size for the text item so that it fills any 
						remaining space in the content row. Behind the scenes 
						there is a minimum and suggested maximum size, for a 
						text item the values are three and 12. If the sizing 
						logic calculates a size below the minimum it will set 
						the size to the suggested maximum and drop the new 
						text item down below its siblings. If the text item 
						is the only item in the content row the suggested 
						maximum width is automatically applied.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the text item to any 
						value between one and 12, they will also be able to 
						set the offsetting value. The offsetting value is the 
						amount of free space that appears to the left of the 
						text item. The sum of the size and offsetting must be 
						a value between one and 12, if the size is set to six 
						the offsetting value will be limited to values between 
						zero and six. The size and position sub tool is 
						available in edit mode along with all the other sub 
						tools.</p>
						
					<p>Once created the content item will behave as a 
						standard text content item.</p>
					
					<h4 id="cm-it-heading">Heading</h4>
					
					<p>The import heading tool allows a user to add a new 
						heading content item using text content from a 
						previously created heading item, both current and 
						deleted. When a user selects the text content to 
						use from the select menu the heading and sub heading 
						fields will be populated with the saved data.</p>
						
					<p>The user is free to modify the imported text, if 
						changed, upon insertion Dlayer will save the new text 
						content to the database and increment the name used 
						to identify the text.</p>
						
					<p>A heading item will automatically be sized to span 
						the entire width of the content row it has been 
						assigned to.</p>
						
					<p>At any point after insertion the user will be able to 
						alter the size and position of the heading item to 
						any value between one and 12, they will also be able 
						to set the offsetting value. The offsetting value 
						is the amount of free space that appears to the left 
						of the heading item. The sum of the size and 
						offsetting must be a value between one and 12, if 
						the size is set to six the offsetting value will be 
						limited to values between zero and six. The size and 
						position sub tool is available in edit mode along 
						with all the other sub tools.</p>
						
					<p>Once created the content item will behave as a standard

					<h4 id="cm-it-jumbotron">Jumbotron</h4>
					
					<p>The import jumbotron tool allows a user to add a new 
						jumbotron content item using text content from a

					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="form-builder">Form builder</h2>
					
					<p>A form allows a user to capture information from their 
						web site users, when used within a widget it can also 
						be used to control flow.</p>
						
					<p>Forms can be added to templates, widgets and directly 
						to content pages as content items, forms consist of 
						any number of fields.</p>
						
					<p>The status of a form can be switched between hidden 
						and live, if a form is marked as hidden it will not 
						appear as a selectable item in any of the form 
						pickers. If a previously live and linked form is 
						switched to hidden previous assignments will remain 
						live, the hidden status will only apply to the latest 
						version of the form not a version which may have been 
						linked to a content page, widget or template earlier. 
						These previous assignments will be easily visible 
						within the Form builder and manageable on an individual 
						basis.</p>
						
					<p>Regardless of how the structure of a form is modified 
						over its life all submitted data is maintained in the 
						original format, no data is ever lost because of a 
						structure change.</p>
						
					<p>There are no artificial limits on the number of forms 
						that can be created for a website, the number of 
						fields on a form or the number of times an individual 
						forms can be linked to a content page, widget or 
						template.</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="widget-designer">Widget designer</h2>
					
					<p>Widgets are reusable content items or collections of 
						reusable content items, some examples of widgets 
						could be the header and menu for a web site, a 
						twitter feed widget, an image gallery, a small 
						call to action or even an entire blog system.</p>
						
					<p>Within Dlayer I consider anything that either can’t be 
					created by a single tool in the Content manager or 
					anything that is going to appear in more than one place 
					to be a widget.</p>
					
					<p>The Widget designer is easily the most complicated 
						designer within Dlayer, it is in effect the Template 
						designer, Content manager and Form builder all 
						rolled into one designer.</p>
						
					<p>A widget can be very complicated or as simple a simple 
						heading which the user intends to appear in multiple 
						places. The Widget designer includes nearly all the 
						tools defined in the Content manager and Template 
						designer along with some that are custom to just the 
						Widget designer.</p>
						
					<p>A widget can be assigned to a template, content page, 
						form or even another widget, there are no limits to 
						the number of times a widget can be assigned to an 
						item, be it a content page or a widget.</p>
						
					<p>There are two sections to the Widget designer, the 
						designer and the library, the designer allows the user 
						to create or modify a widget, the library allows the 
						user to manage their entire library of widgets, the 
						user can organise their widgets, categorise them, 
						copy them to create brand new widgets or delete 
						them.</p>
						
					<p>Whenever a user needs to select a widget they will be 
						presented with the widget picker.</p>
						
					<p>The widget picker works by first asking the user to 
					filter down their select by category and sub category if 
					defined. Once filtered to this level the user will be 
					presented with a list of their widgets in either text or 
					image form, the list format depends on whether or not a 
					preview image has been created for the defined 
					widgets.</p>
					
					<p>Dlayer will include a number of predefined widgets 
						which the user is free to modify in any way they would 
						like, copy or delete.</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="web-site-manager">Web site manager</h2>
					
					<p>The Web site manager is where the user defines the 
						relationships between all the content pages that make 
						up their site, they are essentially creating the 
						structure of their web site.</p>
						
					<p>When a new content page is created, either via the 
					Web site manager or Content manager it will initially be 
					placed into an unassigned pages bucket, from there there 
					user will need to assign its parent and also its 
					relationship with its siblings.</p>
					
					<p>There are no real restrictions with regards to how a 
						user creates the structure of their website, the only 
						real rule being that there must be one content page 
						that acts as the home page.</p>
						
					<p>Changes to content pages will need to be made within 
						the Content manager, the only changes that can be made 
						within the Web site manager are changes to the base 
						details for the page and its position within the site 
						structure. To change a content page the user can simply 
						jump to the Content manager, make their changes and 
						then return to the Web site manager, the state will 
						be maintained.</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="data-manager">Data manager</h2>
					
					<p>Content coming soon!</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="question-manager">Question manager</h2>
					
					<p>Content coming soon!</p>
					
					<hr />
					
					<h2 id="image-library">Image/Media library</h2>
					
					<p>The Image library is where all media management will be 
						done, the Image library is a site wide feature which 
						is exposed to the rest of the app via the image 
						picker.</p>
						
					<p>Image assets can be categorised using any number of 
						custom categories and sub categories, the only 
						enforced rule is that by default an Uncategorised 
						category exists and each newly created category 
						will automatically have a ‘misc’ sub category.</p>
						
					<p>The Image library will include all the standard 
					adjustment and manipulation tools, for example cropping, 
					resizing and basic filters.</p>
					
					<h5>Image picker</h5>
					
					<p>Whenever a user needs to select an image they will be 
						presented with the image picker.</p>
						
					<p>The image picker works by first asking the user to 
						filter down their selection by category and then sub 
						category. At the sub category level the user is 
						presented with a thumbnail list which shows the most 
						recent version for each image along with the name, 
						size and version number. After an image has been 
						selected the user will be asked to select the 
						specific version that they would like to use.</p>
						
					<p>The thumbnail lists will default to sorting in name 
						ascending order but can be easily switched to sort 
						via name, size or uploaded date in ascending or 
						descending order.</p>
						
					<h5>Library</h5>
					
					<p>The Image library can be configured to display either 
						24 small thumbnails per page or 12 larger thumbnails 
						per page, fours rows of either size or three. The 
						display size can be configured within the Image 
						library directly or within the main settings 
						section.</p>
						
					<p>The library can be filtered by any combination of the 
						user’s categories and sub categories, an all sub 
						category is automatically added to each category to 
						allow the user to see all the images within a base 
						category. In addition to filtering the user will 
						also be able to sort their library by name, size 
						and uploaded date in either ascending or descending 
						order. Image library filtering and ordering settings 
						can be saved as user defined views to assist with 
						image management, for example a user could create a 
						view to quickly show the recently uploaded images 
						in their backgrounds category and landscapes sub 
						category.</p>
						
					<p>When an image is selected within the Image library the 
						designer will switch to the full detail view. The 
						detail view shows a fuller size version of the most 
						recent version of the selected image, all the base 
						details, the full version history and the usage 
						details for the currently selected image version.</p>
						
					<p>In the full detail view the side bar will be updated 
						to show all the tools that the user can use to 
						manipulate the selected image.</p>
						
					<p>The version history panel shows all the versions for 
						the selected image, both past and present, it also 
						shows the tool that was used to create the currently 
						selected version, the size details and the date it 
						was created. Other versions can be selected simply 
						by clicking on the version the user wants to view.</p>
						
					<p>The usage panel shows all the places the selected 
						image has and is currently being used, where relevant 
						it will include a link to allow the user to jump 
						directly to the item that uses the image, this could 
						be a content item within the Content manager, a 
						template in the Template designer or a panel in the 
						Widget designer.</p>
						
					<h5>Versioning</h5>
					
					<p>A new version of an image is created each time an 
						image is either modified or referenced, a new version 
						is never created when only the base details are being 
						modified, the base details are the name, description, 
						category and sub category, they exist across image 
						versions.</p>
						
					<p>Not all image versions are created equal, modifications 
						via tools nearly always create a new hard version, 
						when an image is only referenced the designer will 
						create a shallow version, shallow versions are not 
						selectable directly by the user within the Image 
						library or image picker, shallow versions are simply 
						a version of the image that the app can link to, when 
						necessary a shallow version will be converted into a 
						hard version, this will be done behind the scenes.</p>
						
					<p>A shallow version retains a link to the original image 
						and version that the user selected when it was 
						created, this is how the Image library is able to 
						show the usage details for a specific image, these 
						links can also be used to add intelligence to the app, 
						for example to ask the user when they modify an image 
						if they would like to propagate the changes across 
						all the current assignments.</p>
